 * \brief Initializes the audio system.

 * \param freq
 *  Sample rate that the audio device should be opened in.
 *
 * \param format
 *  Audio format. The most common format is AUDIO_S16LSB. The formats are defined by SDL
 *  (SDL_audio.h).
 *
 * \param channels
 *  Amount of output channels to use. Can either be 1 (mono) or 2 (stereo.) Lower or higher values
 *  will be adjusted.
 *
 * \param bufferSize
 *  Size in bytes of the internal buffer that is used to feed audio samples to SDL. Lower values
 *  provide lower latency on audio operations, at the cost of increased CPU usage and risk of audio
 *  drop-outs. A good value for 44.1kHz output for music players is 8192 bytes (8kB), while a game
 *  that needs to play sound effects without much latency would use something like 2048 instead.
 *
 * \return
 *  \retval 0 The audio system was initialized successfully.
 *  \retval !=0 The audio system could not be initialized.
